# Calculator with Undo/Redo

## Description

Build a command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations with full undo/redo functionality. This project reinforces fundamental data structure knowledge by requiring a custom stack implementation (not using Python's built-in list methods directly) to manage operation history. The focus is on understanding how stacks enable state management, writing comprehensive unit tests, and analyzing time/space complexity.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement stack data structure from scratch
- Apply stack to solve a real-world problem (undo/redo)
- Practice test-driven development with pytest
- Document and analyze algorithmic complexity
- Build confidence with fundamental CS concepts
